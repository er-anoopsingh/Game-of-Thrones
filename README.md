# Game-of-Thrones
### An angularjs based website which interacts with an API to display all information about Game of Thrones
===============

This application demonstrates:

* A complete application with read-only data with functionality of searching and sorting
* Using AngularJS with $http in a factory to access an https://anapioficeandfire.com api
* Techniques for showing multiple views of data (card view and list view)
* Custom filters for filtering based on Name, No. of pages etc.
* A custom directive to resolve api returned links into angularjs links 

## Requirements:

### Setting up a server to host the app on your system (you can use any server of your choice):

+ Verify that Node.js is installed. If you see anything when you run `which npm` in a terminal, it is. If not, follow the instructions at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install.
+ Install live-server: `npm install -g live-server`
+ Move your terminal to where your app directory is: `cd <path-to-content>`
+ Start the server: `live-server .`
+ Open [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in a browser.
